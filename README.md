# Floor Plan Generator Using AI
Welcome to your innovation! This is a floor plan generator - a floor plan at your fingertips. All floor plans are created using Artificial Intelligence - By CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem Tree). The backend (AI) is coded in Python and the frontend is coded in Java - they are merged by Jython.
## How are Floor Plans created?
Simply press "Design" and enter your floor area, your room requirements, their quantities, and their sizes. The program instantly curates up to 50 floor plans, which you can rate and save in a file.
